## Common Workflows

**Find issues to work on**
```bash
# List open issues by phase
gh issue list --label "phase-1"

# List critical priority issues
gh issue list --label "priority-critical"
```

**Track progress**
- Use GitHub Projects for kanban board
- Create milestones for each phase
- Link pull requests to issues with "Closes #N"

**Review dependencies**
- Check ROADMAP.md for dependency diagrams
- Review ISSUES.md for dependency lists
- Work through phases in order

## Best Practices

1. ✅ Follow phase order: Start with Phase 1
2. ✅ Create milestones: One per phase
3. ✅ Use GitHub Projects: Visualize workflow
4. ✅ Review ROADMAP.md: Understand dependencies
5. ✅ Link commits: Reference issue numbers

## Critical Path

```
Phase 1.1-1.3 → Phase 2.1-2.4 → Phase 3.1-3.4 → Phase 4.5 → Phase 6.2-6.3
  (Week 1)        (Week 3)         (Week 5)      (Week 7)      (Week 9)
