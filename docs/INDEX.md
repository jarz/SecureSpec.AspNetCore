## 🚀 Getting Started

All 54 GitHub issues have been created based on the PRD specifications.

### Quick Steps

1. Review [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) to understand the work breakdown
2. Check [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for timeline and dependencies
3. Set up GitHub milestones for each phase
4. Create a GitHub Project board to track progress
5. Start with Phase 1 critical path issues

## 📊 By the Numbers

- **54** total issues across 6 phases + cross-cutting
- **500** acceptance criteria mapped from PRD
- **9** weeks estimated implementation time
- **20** critical priority issues
- **24** high priority issues

See [SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md) for complete statistics.

- **Labels**: Issues are tagged with phase, priority, and component labels

See [README.md](README.md) for best practices.

## 📚 Acceptance Criteria Reference

The PRD defines 500 acceptance criteria (AC 1-500):

- **AC 1-400**: Original PRD criteria
- **AC 401-500**: Additional parity confirmations

Each issue references specific AC it fulfills. See [PRD.md](PRD.md) for details.

### Example AC Ranges
- AC 1-10: Canonical serialization
- AC 401-408: SchemaId collision handling
- AC 409-419: CLR primitive mapping
- AC 420-426: Nullability semantics
- AC 427-431: Recursion limits
