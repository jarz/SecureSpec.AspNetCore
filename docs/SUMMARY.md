## Critical Path

The critical path for implementation:

1. **Phase 1.1-1.3** (Week 1): Canonical serializer, SchemaId, type mapping
   - These are foundational and block all other work

2. **Phase 2.1-2.4** (Week 3): Security schemes and OAuth flows
   - Required for secure API exploration

3. **Phase 3.1-3.4** (Week 5): UI framework and Try It Out
   - User-facing functionality

4. **Phase 4.5** (Week 7): WASM sandbox
   - Critical security isolation

5. **Phase 6.2-6.3** (Week 9): CSP and integrity enforcement
   - Final security hardening

## Next Steps

1. **Review the issues**: Check ISSUES.md for details on all 54 issues

2. **Choose creation method**: Select either GitHub CLI or Python script

3. **Test with dry-run**: Always preview before actual creation

4. **Create GitHub milestones**: Consider creating milestones for each phase

5. **Set up project board**: Use GitHub Projects to track progress

6. **Assign issues**: Assign issues to team members based on expertise

7. **Begin implementation**: Start with Phase 1 critical path issues

## Maintenance

- Issues can be edited after creation via GitHub UI
- Update issues.json if changes are needed
- Re-run scripts for new repositories or updated specifications
- Keep PRD.md as the source of truth for acceptance criteria

## Quality Assurance

All issues include:
- ✓ Clear, actionable titles
- ✓ Detailed descriptions
- ✓ Specific acceptance criteria with AC references
- ✓ Estimated effort in days
- ✓ Priority classification
