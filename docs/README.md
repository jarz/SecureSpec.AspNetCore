## Issues Created

All 54 GitHub issues have been created based on the PRD specifications. You can view them in the repository's Issues tab.

## Issue Structure

Each issue contains:

- **Title**: Descriptive title with phase prefix
- **Description**: What needs to be implemented
- **Estimated Effort**: Days of work expected
- **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- **Dependencies**: References to other issues that must be completed first
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific requirements from PRD (AC numbers)
- **Phase**: Which implementation phase the issue belongs to
- **Labels**: For filtering and organization

## Implementation Phases

The project is organized into 6 phases plus cross-cutting concerns:

### Phase 1: Core OpenAPI Generation & Schema Fidelity (Weeks 1-2)
- 8 issues
- Focus: Canonical serialization, SchemaId, type mapping, nullability
- Critical foundation for all subsequent work

### Phase 2: Security Schemes & OAuth Flows (Weeks 3-4)
- 8 issues
- Focus: Authentication schemes, OAuth flows with PKCE, security requirements
- Critical for secure API exploration

### Phase 3: UI & Interactive Exploration (Weeks 5-6)
- 10 issues
- Focus: UI framework, operation display, Try It Out, search/filter
- User-facing functionality

### Phase 4: Performance, Guards & Virtualization (Week 7)
- 7 issues
- Focus: Performance optimization, virtualization, WASM sandbox, caching
- Ensures scalability and security

### Phase 5: Diagnostics, Retention & Concurrency (Week 8)
- 6 issues
- Focus: Diagnostics system, rate limiting, filter pipeline, thread safety
- Production-ready concerns

### Phase 6: Accessibility, CSP & Final Hardening (Week 9)
- 10 issues
- Focus: WCAG 2.1 AA, CSP, integrity enforcement, sanitization
- Security hardening and compliance

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- 5 issues
- Focus: CLI tools, testing, documentation, monitoring
- Ongoing throughout development

**Total**: 54 issues

## Issue Labels

Issues are tagged with the following labels for organization:

### Phase Labels
- `phase-1` through `phase-6`
- `cross-cutting`

### Category Labels
- `core` - Core functionality
- `security` - Security features
- `ui` - User interface
- `performance` - Performance optimizations
- `diagnostics` - Logging and monitoring
- `accessibility` - Accessibility features
- `documentation` - Documentation work
- `testing` - Test creation

### Component Labels
- `serialization` - Serialization logic
- `schema` - Schema generation
- `authentication` - Auth schemes
- `oauth` - OAuth flows
- `operations` - Operation handling
- `caching` - Caching systems
- `sandbox` - WASM sandbox
- `rate-limiting` - Rate limiting

### Priority Labels
- `priority-critical` - Blocking work, must be done
- `priority-high` - Important features
- `priority-medium` - Nice to have
- `priority-low` - Optional enhancements

## Acceptance Criteria (AC) Reference

Each issue references specific Acceptance Criteria (AC) from the PRD.md:

- **AC 1-400**: Original PRD criteria
- **AC 401-500**: Additional parity confirmations (added in final PRD version)

Examples:
- AC 1-10: Canonical serialization
- AC 401-408: SchemaId and collision handling
- AC 409-419: CLR primitive mapping
- AC 420-426: Nullability semantics
- AC 427-431: Recursion and depth limits

Refer to PRD.md for complete details on each AC.

## Dependencies

Issues list their dependencies explicitly:

- Issues should be worked in dependency order
- Phase 1 issues have minimal dependencies
- Later phase issues depend on earlier phases
- Cross-cutting issues reference specific features they support

See ROADMAP.md for visual dependency diagrams.

## Best Practices

1. **Follow the phases**: Work through issues in phase order for optimal dependency management
2. **Create milestones**: Use GitHub milestones for each phase to track progress
3. **Use project boards**: GitHub Projects can help visualize workflow
4. **Review dependencies**: Check ROADMAP.md for dependency chains before starting work
5. **Update as needed**: Issues can be edited through the GitHub UI as requirements evolve

## Support

For questions about:
- **PRD content**: See PRD.md Section 22 (Engineering Hand-Off Checklist)
- **Implementation details**: Refer to specific AC in PRD.md
- **Project planning**: Check ROADMAP.md for timeline and dependencies
