     ```
   - **Restore dependencies**:
     ```bash
     dotnet restore
     ```
   - **Check formatting**:
     ```bash

- Rationale for the enhancement
- Examples of how it would be used
- Any potential drawbacks or alternatives considered

### Pull Requests

#### Before Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Check existing issues**: Look for related issues or create one to discuss your changes
2. **Follow the roadmap**: Align with the project's [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) and phase priorities
3. **Keep changes focused**: One feature or fix per pull request
4. **Write tests**: All new code should have corresponding tests
5. **Update documentation**: Update relevant documentation for your changes

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Follow the coding standards (see below)
   - Keep changes focused and well-tested
   ```bash
   dotnet format SecureSpec.AspNetCore.sln --verify-no-changes
   dotnet test --configuration Release /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=cobertura /p:Threshold=70 /p:ThresholdType=line
   ```

3. **Review locally**:
   - Ensure formatting and tests pass
   - Run any additional checks relevant to your change

4. **Commit your changes**:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `test:` for test additions/changes
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `perf:` for performance improvements
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "type: concise summary"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Reference related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
7. **Respond to feedback**:
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Make requested changes in new commits
   - Mark conversations as resolved when addressed

Follow the [.NET coding conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions):

- Use PascalCase for class names and method names
- Use camelCase for local variables and parameters
- Use meaningful, descriptive names

### Code Organization

### Testing
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies

### Security

This is a security-focused project. All contributions must:

- Never introduce security vulnerabilities
- Follow secure coding practices
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries/commands
- Validate and escape output
- Handle errors securely (no information leakage)
- Consider performance implications (DoS prevention)

Refer to [docs/PRD.md](docs/PRD.md) Section 7 (Threat Model) for security requirements.

### Performance

- Be mindful of performance implications
## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### User Documentation

When adding features, update:
- Relevant files in `docs/` directory
- Code examples and samples
- Migration guides (if breaking changes)

## Issue and Pull Request Labels

We use labels to organize and prioritize work:

### Phase Labels
- `phase-1` through `phase-6`: Indicates implementation phase
- `cross-cutting`: Applies to multiple phases

### Type Labels
- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `enhancement`: New feature or request
- `documentation`: Documentation improvements
- `question`: Further information requested
- `security`: Security-related issue

### Priority Labels
- `priority-critical`: Blocking, must be done
- `priority-high`: Important features
- `priority-medium`: Nice to have
- `priority-low`: Optional enhancements

### Status Labels
- `good-first-issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help-wanted`: Extra attention needed
- `in-progress`: Currently being worked on
- `needs-review`: Ready for review

## Review Process

All submissions require review before merging:

1. **Automated checks**: CI/CD pipeline runs tests and checks
2. **Code review**: At least one maintainer reviews the code
3. **Testing**: Verify functionality works as expected
4. **Documentation review**: Ensure docs are updated
5. **Security review**: For security-sensitive changes

Reviews may take several days. Be patient and responsive to feedback.
